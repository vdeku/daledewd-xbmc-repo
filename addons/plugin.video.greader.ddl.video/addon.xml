Dharma addon to browse through a Google Reader account and stream any hotfile download links found on the resulting feed page.
I prefer to use Google Reader instead of having to deal with each sites individual feeds, like rlslog/rlsbb/scnrls, plus searching feed history is nice.
Right now it only streams from hotfile as it's the only premium account I've kept alive.
It may already allow downloading through the File Manager but I have code ready for a custom context menu entry that works but it's not active.

REQUIREMENTS:
* Google Reader account.
* Premium hotfile account.
* Feeds need to be in at least one folder/category in Google Reader because this script gets a list of folders as the initial index and then drills down from there.
  You can use an existing Reader account as this script won't effect any of your feeds.

MULTIPART RARS:
To stream multipart rars you must create, or add a line to, the autoexec.py file in the userdata folder.
See the autoexec.py file provided with this module which you may copy or use as an example.
Restart XBMC to have it loaded. Then go to the GReader DDL addon settings and enable the REDIRECT SERVER.
If you receive a REDIRECT SERVER CONNECT error then try changing the port number also in the addon settings.
