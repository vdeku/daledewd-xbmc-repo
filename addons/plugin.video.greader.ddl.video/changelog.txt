v1.2.2. Made httpserver.py threaded. Added status of what file/volume is being processed in multirars.

v1.2.1. Using rarfile.py library to find videos in archives. Makes archive streaming *much* more reliable. Should display a notice if passworded archives or archives within archives are detected. Fixed more rar regex matching. Added DEBUG boolean to cut down on debug output.

v1.1.1.. Bug fixes for multipart, and single file, rar regex. Added "informative" progress dialogs. Sort multipart rars for sites that don't already (freshswap). Fix iframe handling for sites that use them (katz). Fixed "Mark feed as read" code. Small performance enhancements. Remove unnecessary debug code. Preparing for other ddl services using jdownloader.

v1.1.0. Streams multirar videos (requires autoexec.py). If hotfile links are in the RSS feed then change color of title to white to stand out (does not mean there are no hotfile links on the actual website page the rss feed points to. this is just for convenience). Misc bug fixes.

v1.0.3. Better hotfile link finding. Handle feeds that use iframes such as katz.

v1.0.2. Fixed search bugs. Show feed content in Movie Information dialog.

v1.0.1. Added search. Added Mark Feed Read to context menu.
